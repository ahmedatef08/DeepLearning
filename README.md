# DeepLearning
The Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset is a benchmark dataset widely used for face recognition and verification tasks. In this project, we implemented and compared three state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: ResNet, DenseNet, and Xception. Each architecture was applied to the LFW dataset
